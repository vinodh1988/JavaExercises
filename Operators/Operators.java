/*
   Operands 
   operators
   operands and operators make an expression

   number of operands is one --- unary operator
   number of operands is two ---- binary operators
   
   Arithmetic Operators- +, -, *, /, %
      any arithmetic expression will always result in largest type
	  in the expression..
	  
   Relational operators -  >,<,>=,<=,==,!=
      any relation expression will always result in boolean
	
   Logical operators --  &&, || and !
   
     Logical expression will also result in boolean
	 Logical expression is built on relational expression

   Increment/Decrement (unary)  ++ and -- (prefix,postfix)

   Bitwise Operators --- &,|,^,>>,<<,~(negation)
